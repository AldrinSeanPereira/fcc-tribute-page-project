# fcc-tribute-page-project
HTML + CSS mini project for freeCodeCamp

This is a special project for me! 

- Its a tribute page to Chester Bennington of Linkin Park
- Its also my first website in 3 or 4 years
- I learned to use center elements using FlexBox - definitely a good learning journey right here
